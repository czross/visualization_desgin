    <h1>Data on Bacteria</h1>
    <div id="Chart1"></div>
    <P>This very first graph is answering the question of; which drug is most effective against
        each of the different type of bacteria.  This bar chart allows a viewer to easily see all of
        the different names of bacteria and compare within each grouping which of the drugs are most
        effective against it.  The decision to use a grouped bar chart was an easy one.  The ability
        for a viewer to use the positioning of the bars along an aligned scale allows for very fast and
        accurate decoding of the information.  The use of different colors, which are more different
        shades, adds another factor that allows a person to decode the information in a quick and
        concise manner.  Adding the dark bars along the rectangles also helps the eye see the different
        contrast between the bars and separate them out.  Sadly this chart is not the best at showing
        the different trends within the data, but that was the allowance made, due to that question not
        being the focus of this chart.  </P>
    <p>The scale on the right side was done in a way that may increase the time for a viewer to decode
        the information, yet it will increase the accuracy.  Due to the wide range that the information
        fell upon it would be impossible for a viewer to perceive the difference, even if there were to
        be some implantation of a framed rectangle.  Yet due to the fact that there were some ranges that
        the bacteria’s effectiveness fell upon it was easy to break up the scale in order for it to be a
        more effective graph.  The numbering along the bottom is to be used in conjunction with the second
        graphic, the scatter plot.  This added feature allowed for a clear and concise representation of
        the scatter plots information that will be discussed shortly.  </p>
    <div id="Chart2"></div>
    <p>This scatter plot is trying to answer the question; is there any relationship between the positivity
        of gram staining and the effectiveness of the two different antibacterial.  A second aspect of this
        graph also shows the relation between the effectiveness between the two different drugs.  The first
        aspect of this graphic that allows for decoding of the data is the positioning of the points along
        similar scales.  This allows a viewer to easily decode which one is greater, lesser, or if two data
        points are very similar.  The second perceptual task that can be used in this graphic is direction.
        There is a direction in how the scatterplot’s points lie and a regression line can at least be
        inferred from this data.  Finally there is the color difference between the points.  The difference
        in color adds the third level of information regarding the gram staining, and if it is positive or
        negative. </p>
    <p>Having the color difference allowed for another piece of information to be decoded from this graph
        and that is groupings.  When a person looks at this graph they are able to see how the positive and
        negative stains are grouped.  This shows that while there seems to be somewhat of an even spread
        among the positive grouping, the negative grouping is very much clustered between 1 and 2.  And while
        there is no actual encapsulating of this information the grouping is still clear.  Just as the last
        graph had a non-linear scale so too does this one.  Due to the data having such a great range of
        numbers, and becoming so precise at certain points, accuracy was deemed to be an important factor
        in this graphic and thus the scale was designed in such a fashion.  </p>
    <div id="Chart3"></div>
    <p>The final graph is one that answers a much broad question which is; how is the effectiveness of
        penicillin distributed among the ranges of 800+, 1-800, and less than 1.  Due to dealing with percent
        it was deemed that a labeled pie chart would be appropriate to display this data.  In order to decode
        this data the main perceptual task used would be the detection of difference in angle.  Due to this
        being one of the less accurate decoding techniques, adding the actual numeric values to the chart
        helped to increase decoding accuracy.  What this pie chart does is allow a viewer to see that there is
        a relatively similar distribution among the different groupings at a glance.  If they wanted to
        increase the accuracy of the information gained it would only take a moment to look at the actual
        percent themselves allowing for the most accurate decoding of data.  The other aspect that was used to
        help in the information decoding process was the color difference.  This allows a person, without even
        looking at the legend, to determine that there are three different groupings within this chart.  The
        contrast between the colors means that there is no confusion as to where one group ends and another
        begins. </p>
